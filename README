Program usage: "Numerov-analysis" is an executable file which fits a QM
wavefunction to an arbitrary potential, given a mass. From this wave-
function, the Energies associated with vibrational transitions can be
computed.

Program parameters are as follows:

 ./Numerov-Analysis num_energy_levels system_mass x_min x_max < potential_input.dat

num_energy_levels: integer number; the number of energy levels (including the grounds state)
	for which QM wavefunctions will be computed.

system_mass: the reduced mass of the system in question in Atomic Unites
	for OH, this value is 1728.1
	for OD, this value is 3261

x_min: the lower bound of the spline (the first data point in an increasing
	domain to which the spline will be fit).

x_max: the upper bound of the spline (the last data point in an increasing
        domain to which the spline will be fit).
 
	x_min and x_max are necessary because the spline function is a good
	approximation of the arbitrary potential *within the bounds of the
	specified data range* but is not a good approximation for the value
	of the arbitrary potential outside of this domain.
		i.e., splining is good for interpolation, but not for
			extrapolation

< potential_input.dat: a file which, in two columns (the first column being
	x-values and the second being y-values) specifies the arbitrary 
	potential to which a wavefunction will be fit

PROGRAM OUTPUT:

Wavefunctions for particular E-levels are output to unique files designated
	by the system mass. 

	ex: E_level0_m1728.1 (file containing wavefunction for the groundstate
		of an OH oscillator in an arbitrary potential. Cols 1:2 
		define the wavefunction, cols 1:3 define the probability
		distribution function-eg, psi^2).

	ex: E_level1_m1728.1 (file containing wavefunction for the first
		excited state).

While Wavefunctions are being written to their respective files, the Energy
	Eigenvalues (in atomic units and in kcal/mol) are sent to STDERR
	(which by default is the terminal screen unless a redirect is
	imposed)

------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTE-----------------------------------

For some calculations, the step size utilized in the main routine of the program
(the variable "s" in "main.cpp", which is converted into "reduced_s" in the 
same program) may be too large to accurately compute a wavefunction for a 
given potential. In these situations, it may be wise to change the step size
and experiment to see what size of s will give a converged solution.
